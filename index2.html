      GTA 5 Sales Are Slowing Down</h2>
  </section>
  <section>
  <p>
    After years of record-breaking performance, GTA 5â€™s sales are finally slowing. Normally, the game sold about 5 million copies every three months, but this time sales did not meet expectations. By May 2025, GTA 5 had sold 215 million copies, slightly below the expected 220 million.
Despite this, the overall GTA franchise has sold 455 million copies worldwide. Just 45 million more sales are needed to hit the historic 500 million mark, which analysts expect wll be achieved once GTA 6 launches.

      A key Rockstar veteran, Lazlow Jones, who worked on GTA radio stations since GTA 3 and even appeared as a character in GTA 5, has confirmed he wonâ€™t be part of GTA 6. Lazlow left Rockstar in 2020, shortly after co-founder Dan Houser also departed to form a new studio, Absurd Ventures.
